Classy Taxi: Google Play Billing Subscriptions Android App Kotlin Sample
=====================================================

This is the ClassyTaxi Kotlin Android app to buy subscriptions.

Classy Taxi is an end-to-end project that highlights subscription features on Google Play Billing,
such as Real-time Developer Notifications, account hold, grace period, and more. The code has 3
major components: an **Android app** to buy subscriptions,
a **[Node.js server](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer)**
to manage subscriptions, and a
read-only **[web client](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiAppWeb)**
to access the subscriptions on multiple platforms.

# Clone the sample project

    git clone https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples.git

# What do I need?

* A [Google Play Developer Account](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/) to publish
  the app and manage subscriptions

* A [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) to deploy the server implementation on
  [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/), enable sign-in, and
  support Firebase Cloud Messaging

    * Note: The Firebase project has a corresponding Google Cloud Console project that will be
      configured for Real-time Developer Notifications

* A [Google Cloud Console project](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#linking_your_api_project)
to use the Google Play APIs

    * Note: This is usually a different Google Cloud Console project than the one used with Firebase

# Summary: What order should I do things?

1. Choose the **Android package name**

1. Start the **Firebase Project Setup**

    * Firebase setup requires that you know the Android package name

    * You can add the SHA1 signature information to the Firebase console later

1. Complete the **Android App Setup**

    * The Android app will not build without `google-services.json` from Firebase

1. **Upload a release-build APK** signed with release keys to Google Play

    * To use Google Play Billing APIs you need an APK to published to a track on Google Play
      (internal testing, closed testing, open testing, or production track)

        * [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213)

1. Complete the **Firebase Project Setup**

    * If you skipped the Firebase configuration step for the SHA1 fingerprint, you can complete that
      step now by rebuilding with the updated `google-services.json`
    * If you are using Google Play Signing, you can get the SHA1 on the Google Play Console under
      **Setup > App Integrity**

1. Start the **Play Developer Console Setup**

    * Google Play Billing APIs require the SKUs to be configured in the console

1. Optional: Test with a debug APK and debug signatures on your device

    * Add your test Google account to the License Testing section of your Google Play Developer
      Account

        * [https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing#one-time](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing#one-time)

        * [https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing#subs](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing#subs)

    * **License Testing accounts can use the Google Play Billing APIs with debug builds and debug
      signatures as long as the package name matches the APK in the Play Store**

    * If the Google account is not enabled for License Testing, Google Play Billing APIs will only
      work if the app is installed by Google Play

        * **Sideloaded APKs will not work for users that are not enabled for License Testing**

1. Complete the **Play Developer Console Setup**

    * Link your Google Cloud Console project to the Google Play Developer Account

        * Note: A Google Play Console account can only be linked to a single Google Cloud Console
          project, so **we recommend creating a dedicated Google Cloud Console project that is
          shared by all apps in your Google Play Console**

        * Configure a service account in Google Cloud Console

1. Complete **Real-time Developer Notifications Setup**

1. **Deploy [Backend Server](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer)**

1. Complete the **Regenerate and re-upload App** step

# Firebase Project Setup

This sample application uses Firebase (Auth, Notifications, Firestore).

1. Go to **Firebase Console** and create a Firebase project

    * [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

1. In the project, go to Build > Cloud Firestore > Create database > Start in **production mode**

1. In the project, go to Build > Functions> Get started. Enable Functions.

1. In the project, go to Build > Authentication > Get started > Sign-in method. Enable **
   Email/Password** and **Google**
   as Sign-in providers

1. Add your Android app to the project

    * [https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase)

1. Add your app's SHA1 fingerprint for Google Sign-In

    * [https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/firebaseui#before_you_begin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/firebaseui#before_you_begin)

    * Specify your app's SHA-1 fingerprint from
      the [Settings page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/)
      of the Firebase console

    * See [Authenticating Your Client](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth)
      for details on how to get your app's SHA-1 fingerprint

    * If you do not know your SHA1 fingerprint yet, please skip it for now and return after you have
      signed your APK later


# Android App Setup

To use the Google Play Billing APIs, you must pick a unique package name and upload a
[signed release APK](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html) to Google Play.
The Android app will only build after you include a compatible `google-services.json` file from the
Firebase configuration.

## Build your APK from Android Studio

1. Open Android Studio, select File > Open and pick the root build.gradle file

    * `{project_folder}/build.gradle`

1. Change the `androidApplicationId` to the correct Android package name

    * `{project_folder}/gradle.properties`

1. Confirm that you have the latest `google-services.json` from the Firebase configuration in your
   app directory

    * `{project_folder}/app/google-services.json`

1. Optional: If you want to test the UI without the Firebase server, change this variable in
   `Constants.kt`

    * `USE_FAKE_SERVER = true`

1. Remove the google-services.json configuration file located in the app’s debug folder.

    * `{project_folder}/app/src/debug/`

1. Rebuild the Gradle project verify that there are no errors

1. Sign a release build with your release key

    * [https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk)

1. If you skipped the Firebase configuration step for the SHA1 fingerprint, you can complete that
   step now, and rebuild with the updated `google-services.json`

    * If you are using Google Play Signing, you can get the SHA1 on the Google Play Console under
      **Setup > App Integrity**

# Play Developer Console Setup

1. Create an application in the Google Play Developer Console

    * [https://play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console)

1. Upload and publish the release App Bundle/APK to the Internal testing, Closed testing, Open testing, or Production track

    * [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469)

1. Create subscription products for a Basic Subscription and Premium Subscription

    * [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/140504](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/140504)

    * The Android app `Constants.kt` contains 2 SKUs: `"basic_subscription"`
      and `"premium_subscription"`.

    * Use the 2 SKUs as the Product ID when creating the subscription products

    * Write down your product IDs (SKUs) so you can configure your backend server

1. Link the Google Cloud Console project to the Google Play Developer Account

    * [https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#linking_your_api_project](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#linking_your_api_project)

    * Use the Google Cloud Console project that corresponds to your Google Play Developer Account

    * Enable API access using a service account

        * [https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#using_a_service_account](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#using_a_service_account)

    * Create a new private key for your service account, and download it in JSON format with the
      filename `service-account.json`

    * Copy `service-account.json` to the ClassyTaxiServer folder

        * `{project_folder}/ClassyTaxiServer/src/service-account.json`

    * Provide the necessary **Account permission** to the service account email
      address [https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions](https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions)

        * **View financial data, orders, and cancellation survey responses**

        * **Manage orders and subscriptions**

        * **View app information and download bulk reports (read-only)**

1. Recommended: Create a license test account
   to [test subscriptions quickly](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/01/faster-renewals-for-test-subscriptions.html)
   without spending money

# Real-time Developer Notifications Setup

1. Use the Google Cloud Console project that corresponds to the Firebase project to
   enable [Cloud PubSub](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub?tutorial=pubsub_quickstart&_ga=2.248010692.2130588993.1635461725-2065840594.1635461725)

    * [https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/realtime_developer_notifications#initial_cloud_pubsub_setup](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/realtime_developer_notifications#initial_cloud_pubsub_setup)

    * Name your PubSub topic: `play-subs`

    * Add the Google Play service account to the topic

        * `google-play-developer-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com`

    * In the Permissions section, select **Add Member** and grant the Role **Pub/Sub Publisher** to
      the Google Play service account

        * Note: Make sure to set the role as **Publisher** so that Google Play can publish updates
          to your project

    * Copy the **Topic name** so that you can add it to the Google Play Console

1. Configure the Google Play Console to allow your backend to receive notifications from Play Store
   for subscription purchase changes

    * [https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#enable-rtdn](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#enable-rtdn)

    * Your real-time developer notifications **Topic name** should be in this format

        * `projects/{your_firebase_project_id}/topics/play-subs`

# Deploy Backend Server

Follow the steps to deploy the backend server here:
[here](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer). Note: Please
take a note of the endpoint server URL/Function URL when your functions are successfully deployed. It should be
in this example’s format: “https://us-central1-project_name.cloudfunctions.net”

# Regenerate and re-upload App

1. Open the app module build.gradle file

1. Update the **SERVER_URL** in the buildtype DSL object for the debug and release builds

```
buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
            buildConfigField("String", "SERVER_URL", "\"https://us-central1-project_name.cloudfunctions.net\"")
        }
        debug {
            minifyEnabled false
            buildConfigField("String", "SERVER_URL", "\"https://us-central1-project_name.cloudfunctions.net\"")
        }
    }
```

1. Re-generate a new app bundle and upload it to a new Play store release


# Troubleshoot common issues

* Q: There is a warning "*Billing account not configured. External network is not accessible and
  quotas are severely limited. Configure billing account to remove these restrictions*" in my Cloud
  Functions log.

    * A: You can safely ignore the warning and stay use the Firebase Spark Plan because the sample
      only accesses the Google network.

* Q: The logs on your server show an error: "*Unexpected error when querying Google Play Developer
  API. Please check if you use a correct service account*".

    * A: Check that the `service-account.json` that you deployed to your server matches the service
      account email that is registered in the Google Play Console
      [https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/api-access](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/api-access)
      .

* Q: "*The current user has insufficient permissions to perform the requested operation.*"

    * A: Check that the the service account email that is registered in the Google Play Console has
      the necessary **Account
      permission** [https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions](https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions)
        * **View financial data, orders, and cancellation survey responses**
        * **Manage orders and subscriptions**

* Q: Android
  build: `Execution failed for task :app:processDebugGoogleServices. File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it`
  .

    * A: Download `google-services.json` from the Firebase console.

* Q: Android
  build: `No matching client found for package name com.example.subscriptions.classytaxi'`.

    * A: Change the `androidApplicationId` in `gradle.properties` and download the updated
      `google-services.json` from your Firebase project configuration.

* Q: Real-time Developer Notifications are not working.

    * A: Make sure the Google Play service account has access as the **Publisher** so Google Play
      can publish updates to you.

* Q: Unable to upload the App Bundle to the Play store release with the error `Version code has already been used. Try another version code`

    * A: Update the `androidMobileVersionCode` in the `gradle.properties` file.

# Optional: Build the Android app from the command line

The sample allows you to specify signing keys and a package name with the Gradle command line. This
allows you to build and sign a release APK without making any modifications to the git repository.
The sample contains a file `example-keystore.properties` that you can copy (or modify) to meet your
needs.

1. Create a file `release-keystore.properties` with your release key information (see
   `example-keystore.properties` for the expected format)

    * [https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#signing-manually](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#signing-manually)

1. Download the generated `google-services.json` and move it to your app module directory

    * `{project_folder}/app/google-services.json`

1. Run the following Gradle command in the directory `{project_folder}`

    * Replace the Android application ID with your unique package name

          ./gradlew -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties assembleRelease

1. Find the location of the output APK

       {project_folder}/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

1. Deploy this APK to your Internal Test track for fast development

    * [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213)

## Android files required for a release APK with release keys

* Keystore: `release.jks`
* Passwords: `release-keystore.properties`
* Firebase configuration: `google-services.json`

## Full list of commands to build a release APK

    cd {project_folder}

    ### Put release keystore information in the root project directory
    cp /path/to/your/secrets/release.jks .
    cp /path/to/your/secrets/release-keystore.properties .

    ### Put Firebase google-services.json in the `app/` directory
    cp /path/to/your/secrets/google-services.json ./app/google-services.json

    ### Check to make sure the files are in the correct location
    ls -1 *.jks *keystore.properties
    # debug.jks
    # keystore.properties
    # release-keystore.properties
    # release.jks

    ### Make sure you are not tracking any secret files in git
    git status
    # On branch master
    # nothing to commit, **working tree clean**

    ### Release build with release keys
    ./gradlew -PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package assembleRelease

    ### Debug build with release keys
    ./gradlew -PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package assembleDebug

    ### Specify version name and version code
    ./gradlew -PandroidMobileVersionName=1.0.1 -PandroidMobileVersionCode=2 -PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package assembleRelease

    ### Note: Release builds must be installed by Google Play.
    ### This means you must deploy release builds to a
    ### track on Google Play in order to use the Google Play Billing APIs.
    ### Use debug builds to sideload the app for testing.
    ### Android Studio creates debug builds by default.
    ### Gradle will create debug builds with the task `assembleDebug`.
